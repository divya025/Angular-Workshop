Angular Workshop- Day 3
================================

Recap
------------
One way binding : Box []
Event Listener : ()
Two way Bining : Banana in a box [( )]

Parent-Child Component 
-------------------------
@Input : indicates the value is inherited or input from the Parent
@Output : the value that will be emitted by the child.

Understanding the code
----------------------------------------

- Constructor is loaded before the angular components are created and ngInit is called. So services should be under ngInit for purpose of debugging the services.
- Angular  material icon : Replace the text (star with face) will change the icon

--- Promise vs Observable
- When nobody is subscribed to promise , even then  promise is started and terminates.
- Observable on the other hand does not start when there are no subscribers.
- On time out of subscriber the observable terminates.
- Promise is executed only once. If you re-execute promise again same value is returned. To re-execute the promise you have to create a new promise.
- Observable on the other hand returns two different values.

- To see the path where file will be created use : ng g s hello --dry-run  ( generate a service )

- Some important funtions : RxJs
..   import "rxjs/add/operator/debounceTime";
..   import "rxjs/add/operator/distinctUntilChanged";
..   import "rxjs/add/operator/switchMap"
